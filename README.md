# inharmonicity_modulation
This is a code repository for the paper 'Non-linear relationships between auditory mismatch responses and the inharmonicity of complex sounds'.

To replicate the results, download the raw data and run scripts in the indicated order. Scripts 00-03 require a parameter (participant ID) to work.Scripts include a `raw_path` variable that needs to point to raw data.

Raw dataset can be found here [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.15341474.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15341474).
